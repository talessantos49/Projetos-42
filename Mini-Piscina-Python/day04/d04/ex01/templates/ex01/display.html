    <h1>Display</h1>
    <p>A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored,[1] in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.[2]
        Consequently, a static web page often displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.[3] However, a site's scripts can introduce dynamic functionality, which may make a static web page appear dynamic.</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Static web pages are often HTML documents[4] stored as files in the file system and made available by the web server over HTTP (nevertheless URLs ending with ".html" are not always static). However, loose interpretations of the term could include web pages stored in a database, and could even include pages formatted using a template and served through an application server, as long as the page served is unchanging and presented essentially as stored.
        Static web pages are suitable for content that never or rarely needs to be updated, though modern web template systems are changing this. Maintaining large numbers of static pages as files can be impractical without automated tools, such as static site generators. Any personalization or interactivity has to run client-side, which is restricting.[5]
        Advantages of a static website
        Provide improved security over dynamic websites (dynamic websites are at risk to web shell attacks if a vulnerability is present)[6]
        Improved performance for end users compared to dynamic websites[7]
        Fewer or no dependencies on systems such as databases or other application servers [8]
        Cost savings from utilizing cloud storage, as opposed to a hosted environment[9]
        Security configurations are easy to setup, which makes it more secure[10]
        Disadvantages of a static website
        Dynamic functionality must be performed on the client side[5]</p>
